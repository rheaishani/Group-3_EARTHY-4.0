The majority of the Zatari camp population (56%) is under 18, and they have mostly not experienced life elsewhere. Culture is being treated as secondary since organizations are only focusing on essential needs. We propose a cultural center built by the people themselves, allowing for the transfer of Syrian culture, knowledge, and craftsmanship to the younger generation.The center will be an outlet for cultural expression - a space for people to learn, have fun, and connect with/experience their cultural identity, reinstating culture back into the camp and creating a sense of belonging. The spaces will grow and adapt to meet people's growing needs.
